1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Excited to join you virtually today at your conference here.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
I hope you're having a wonderful event.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Very appreciative of the Mox invitation for me to share a few words.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Now, I had the privilege of being able to join you back in May in Baltimore,

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
and wow, that was an awesome experience.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I loved every minute of the energy in that room.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Now, here we are, a little over a half year later, and we've started 2023.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Now, of course, it's worth acknowledging that in 2022, it was quite a year.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
It was a year filled with various challenges, challenges within the Amway business,

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
and challenges in the broader marketplace around us.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
But 2022 is over, and we set our sights on the future,

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
based in the present, here in January of 2023.

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
And I have to say, I am very excited about what the future holds

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
for the Amway business in North America,

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,000
more specifically for what the future holds for the BWW business in North America.

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
What we're here to talk about today is reigniting growth in the marketplace,

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
and I know that's something that all of us aspire to.

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Now, I look at the situation at present with excitement and confidence.

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I look at it with confidence because I believe there has never been a better time

20
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
to build the Amway business in North America than right now.

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Products, incentives, tools, the needs in the marketplace,

22
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
most importantly, the leadership.

23
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
The leadership that's in this room right here.

24
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:44,000
The Mock within BWW is a group that I am in partnership in close communication with regularly.

25
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Galas, Kumars, the Nardonis, the Malillos, the Millers.

26
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
These are business owners who have built amazing Amway businesses,

27
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
and it's my privilege to be in partnership with them.

28
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I know for our conversations that they are confident about the future,

29
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
and I am confident because we're in partnership together,

30
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
building for this exciting future.

31
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
So I want to challenge every IVO in the room here,

32
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
whether you've been in the business for decades,

33
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
or whether this is your first major event,

34
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
to dream big, to set goals,

35
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
and to work your tail off to go achieve those goals.

36
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Because at the end of the day, the only person that can make it happen is you.

37
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
We're going to provide you with every available ounce of support we can,

38
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
as is everyone applying in the LOS, you're applying platinum, you're applying diamond,

39
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
but at the end of the day, only you can do it.

40
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:44,000
You've got to set that goal that takes you one step higher in your business than where you are today.

41
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
And so if you didn't come into today's event with a goal that stretches you

42
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
into a little bit of discomfort,

43
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I want to challenge you to walk away with a goal that does just that.

44
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Because only through stretching ourselves beyond where we thought we could go

45
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
will we achieve that growth that we're all capable of achieving.

46
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:09,000
And BWW has set the precedent of achieving growth for decades in the MWI business,

47
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,000
and I'm confident that will continue for decades to come.

48
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,000
And it's not just the fact that your goals and your hard work is going to take us there.

49
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,000
It's our commitment from the MWI Corporation to give you the tangible things you need

50
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
to help your business thrive.

51
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I'm going to start by focusing on bronze.

52
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
This new incentive is powerful.

53
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,000
It's a powerful incentive for business builders to build a solid, profitable structure

54
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
early in their journey to help accelerate their pathway

55
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
of the performance bonus schedule toward qualification.

56
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,000
If you're not currently taking advantage of bronze in your team or personally,

57
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I want to challenge you to make it part of your goal.

58
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
If you don't know enough about bronze yet, ask your upline.

59
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Get educated on how you can earn it or how your team can earn it.

60
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
And if you're a leader and you're not focused on bronze in your team,

61
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I want to challenge you to do exactly that.

62
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,000
To help your downlines have the right structure to earn these meaningful incentives

63
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
to help accelerate their business growth.

64
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
But it's not just incentives.

65
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
It's also the products that we're going to continue to put in the market

66
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
to help you serve your customers.

67
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,000
We have launched literally dozens of new products over the past several years

68
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,000
that have been effective at helping you serve your customers, but we're not done there.

69
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
We're continuing to invest in new products.

70
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
And this year has an exciting schedule of new product launches.

71
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Look for what we're going to be doing with the Neutrolite brand in 2023

72
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,000
to bring more excitement and energy to our most important product brand.

73
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I know your leadership is going to be sharing more information soon.

74
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:58,000
So here we are in January looking ahead to what I'm confident is going to be

75
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
an exciting, productive year.

76
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I know that you're all going to set goals.

77
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
You're going to stretch yourself into an area of discomfort,

78
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
but you're going to grow by striving for that goal,

79
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,000
for focusing on the incentives that reward sustainable, profitable structures,

80
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,000
and for serving your customers with the great products that we offer.

81
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
And we're going to do it all in partnership as we always have done.

82
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
The same foundation that Bill and Peggy built,

83
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
and I am fortunate enough to continue to build with,

84
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Mock, Cowles, Kumar's, the Nardonis, the Millers, and the Malillos,

85
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
and all the other leaders across BWW.

86
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Thank you for everything that you do every single day to continue to build your business.

87
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
The whole corporation stands behind you and supports you.

88
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I look forward to hopefully seeing you soon, but until then, be well.
