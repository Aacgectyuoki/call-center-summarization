0	5000	Excited to join you virtually today at your conference here.
5000	7000	I hope you're having a wonderful event.
7000	13000	Very appreciative of the Mox invitation for me to share a few words.
13000	18000	Now, I had the privilege of being able to join you back in May in Baltimore,
18000	21000	and wow, that was an awesome experience.
21000	24000	I loved every minute of the energy in that room.
24000	29000	Now, here we are, a little over a half year later, and we've started 2023.
29000	34000	Now, of course, it's worth acknowledging that in 2022, it was quite a year.
34000	39000	It was a year filled with various challenges, challenges within the Amway business,
39000	42000	and challenges in the broader marketplace around us.
42000	46000	But 2022 is over, and we set our sights on the future,
46000	49000	based in the present, here in January of 2023.
49000	54000	And I have to say, I am very excited about what the future holds
54000	56000	for the Amway business in North America,
56000	62000	more specifically for what the future holds for the BWW business in North America.
62000	67000	What we're here to talk about today is reigniting growth in the marketplace,
67000	70000	and I know that's something that all of us aspire to.
70000	76000	Now, I look at the situation at present with excitement and confidence.
76000	81000	I look at it with confidence because I believe there has never been a better time
81000	85000	to build the Amway business in North America than right now.
86000	91000	Products, incentives, tools, the needs in the marketplace,
91000	94000	most importantly, the leadership.
94000	97000	The leadership that's in this room right here.
97000	104000	The Mock within BWW is a group that I am in partnership in close communication with regularly.
104000	108000	Galas, Kumars, the Nardonis, the Malillos, the Millers.
108000	112000	These are business owners who have built amazing Amway businesses,
112000	115000	and it's my privilege to be in partnership with them.
115000	119000	I know for our conversations that they are confident about the future,
119000	123000	and I am confident because we're in partnership together,
123000	125000	building for this exciting future.
125000	128000	So I want to challenge every IVO in the room here,
128000	130000	whether you've been in the business for decades,
130000	133000	or whether this is your first major event,
133000	136000	to dream big, to set goals,
136000	140000	and to work your tail off to go achieve those goals.
140000	145000	Because at the end of the day, the only person that can make it happen is you.
145000	150000	We're going to provide you with every available ounce of support we can,
150000	155000	as is everyone applying in the LOS, you're applying platinum, you're applying diamond,
155000	158000	but at the end of the day, only you can do it.
158000	164000	You've got to set that goal that takes you one step higher in your business than where you are today.
164000	168000	And so if you didn't come into today's event with a goal that stretches you
168000	170000	into a little bit of discomfort,
170000	175000	I want to challenge you to walk away with a goal that does just that.
175000	179000	Because only through stretching ourselves beyond where we thought we could go
179000	183000	will we achieve that growth that we're all capable of achieving.
183000	189000	And BWW has set the precedent of achieving growth for decades in the MWI business,
189000	194000	and I'm confident that will continue for decades to come.
194000	199000	And it's not just the fact that your goals and your hard work is going to take us there.
199000	204000	It's our commitment from the MWI Corporation to give you the tangible things you need
204000	207000	to help your business thrive.
207000	210000	I'm going to start by focusing on bronze.
210000	213000	This new incentive is powerful.
213000	218000	It's a powerful incentive for business builders to build a solid, profitable structure
218000	222000	early in their journey to help accelerate their pathway
222000	226000	of the performance bonus schedule toward qualification.
226000	231000	If you're not currently taking advantage of bronze in your team or personally,
231000	234000	I want to challenge you to make it part of your goal.
234000	237000	If you don't know enough about bronze yet, ask your upline.
237000	242000	Get educated on how you can earn it or how your team can earn it.
242000	245000	And if you're a leader and you're not focused on bronze in your team,
245000	248000	I want to challenge you to do exactly that.
248000	253000	To help your downlines have the right structure to earn these meaningful incentives
253000	256000	to help accelerate their business growth.
256000	258000	But it's not just incentives.
258000	261000	It's also the products that we're going to continue to put in the market
261000	263000	to help you serve your customers.
263000	268000	We have launched literally dozens of new products over the past several years
268000	273000	that have been effective at helping you serve your customers, but we're not done there.
273000	276000	We're continuing to invest in new products.
276000	280000	And this year has an exciting schedule of new product launches.
280000	284000	Look for what we're going to be doing with the Neutrolite brand in 2023
284000	289000	to bring more excitement and energy to our most important product brand.
289000	293000	I know your leadership is going to be sharing more information soon.
293000	298000	So here we are in January looking ahead to what I'm confident is going to be
298000	301000	an exciting, productive year.
301000	304000	I know that you're all going to set goals.
304000	307000	You're going to stretch yourself into an area of discomfort,
307000	310000	but you're going to grow by striving for that goal,
310000	315000	for focusing on the incentives that reward sustainable, profitable structures,
315000	320000	and for serving your customers with the great products that we offer.
320000	324000	And we're going to do it all in partnership as we always have done.
324000	327000	The same foundation that Bill and Peggy built,
327000	331000	and I am fortunate enough to continue to build with,
331000	337000	Mock, Cowles, Kumar's, the Nardonis, the Millers, and the Malillos,
337000	340000	and all the other leaders across BWW.
340000	346000	Thank you for everything that you do every single day to continue to build your business.
346000	350000	The whole corporation stands behind you and supports you.
350000	355000	I look forward to hopefully seeing you soon, but until then, be well.
