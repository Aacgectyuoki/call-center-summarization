WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
Excited to join you virtually today at your conference here.

00:05.000 --> 00:07.000
I hope you're having a wonderful event.

00:07.000 --> 00:13.000
Very appreciative of the Mox invitation for me to share a few words.

00:13.000 --> 00:18.000
Now, I had the privilege of being able to join you back in May in Baltimore,

00:18.000 --> 00:21.000
and wow, that was an awesome experience.

00:21.000 --> 00:24.000
I loved every minute of the energy in that room.

00:24.000 --> 00:29.000
Now, here we are, a little over a half year later, and we've started 2023.

00:29.000 --> 00:34.000
Now, of course, it's worth acknowledging that in 2022, it was quite a year.

00:34.000 --> 00:39.000
It was a year filled with various challenges, challenges within the Amway business,

00:39.000 --> 00:42.000
and challenges in the broader marketplace around us.

00:42.000 --> 00:46.000
But 2022 is over, and we set our sights on the future,

00:46.000 --> 00:49.000
based in the present, here in January of 2023.

00:49.000 --> 00:54.000
And I have to say, I am very excited about what the future holds

00:54.000 --> 00:56.000
for the Amway business in North America,

00:56.000 --> 01:02.000
more specifically for what the future holds for the BWW business in North America.

01:02.000 --> 01:07.000
What we're here to talk about today is reigniting growth in the marketplace,

01:07.000 --> 01:10.000
and I know that's something that all of us aspire to.

01:10.000 --> 01:16.000
Now, I look at the situation at present with excitement and confidence.

01:16.000 --> 01:21.000
I look at it with confidence because I believe there has never been a better time

01:21.000 --> 01:25.000
to build the Amway business in North America than right now.

01:26.000 --> 01:31.000
Products, incentives, tools, the needs in the marketplace,

01:31.000 --> 01:34.000
most importantly, the leadership.

01:34.000 --> 01:37.000
The leadership that's in this room right here.

01:37.000 --> 01:44.000
The Mock within BWW is a group that I am in partnership in close communication with regularly.

01:44.000 --> 01:48.000
Galas, Kumars, the Nardonis, the Malillos, the Millers.

01:48.000 --> 01:52.000
These are business owners who have built amazing Amway businesses,

01:52.000 --> 01:55.000
and it's my privilege to be in partnership with them.

01:55.000 --> 01:59.000
I know for our conversations that they are confident about the future,

01:59.000 --> 02:03.000
and I am confident because we're in partnership together,

02:03.000 --> 02:05.000
building for this exciting future.

02:05.000 --> 02:08.000
So I want to challenge every IVO in the room here,

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
whether you've been in the business for decades,

02:10.000 --> 02:13.000
or whether this is your first major event,

02:13.000 --> 02:16.000
to dream big, to set goals,

02:16.000 --> 02:20.000
and to work your tail off to go achieve those goals.

02:20.000 --> 02:25.000
Because at the end of the day, the only person that can make it happen is you.

02:25.000 --> 02:30.000
We're going to provide you with every available ounce of support we can,

02:30.000 --> 02:35.000
as is everyone applying in the LOS, you're applying platinum, you're applying diamond,

02:35.000 --> 02:38.000
but at the end of the day, only you can do it.

02:38.000 --> 02:44.000
You've got to set that goal that takes you one step higher in your business than where you are today.

02:44.000 --> 02:48.000
And so if you didn't come into today's event with a goal that stretches you

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
into a little bit of discomfort,

02:50.000 --> 02:55.000
I want to challenge you to walk away with a goal that does just that.

02:55.000 --> 02:59.000
Because only through stretching ourselves beyond where we thought we could go

02:59.000 --> 03:03.000
will we achieve that growth that we're all capable of achieving.

03:03.000 --> 03:09.000
And BWW has set the precedent of achieving growth for decades in the MWI business,

03:09.000 --> 03:14.000
and I'm confident that will continue for decades to come.

03:14.000 --> 03:19.000
And it's not just the fact that your goals and your hard work is going to take us there.

03:19.000 --> 03:24.000
It's our commitment from the MWI Corporation to give you the tangible things you need

03:24.000 --> 03:27.000
to help your business thrive.

03:27.000 --> 03:30.000
I'm going to start by focusing on bronze.

03:30.000 --> 03:33.000
This new incentive is powerful.

03:33.000 --> 03:38.000
It's a powerful incentive for business builders to build a solid, profitable structure

03:38.000 --> 03:42.000
early in their journey to help accelerate their pathway

03:42.000 --> 03:46.000
of the performance bonus schedule toward qualification.

03:46.000 --> 03:51.000
If you're not currently taking advantage of bronze in your team or personally,

03:51.000 --> 03:54.000
I want to challenge you to make it part of your goal.

03:54.000 --> 03:57.000
If you don't know enough about bronze yet, ask your upline.

03:57.000 --> 04:02.000
Get educated on how you can earn it or how your team can earn it.

04:02.000 --> 04:05.000
And if you're a leader and you're not focused on bronze in your team,

04:05.000 --> 04:08.000
I want to challenge you to do exactly that.

04:08.000 --> 04:13.000
To help your downlines have the right structure to earn these meaningful incentives

04:13.000 --> 04:16.000
to help accelerate their business growth.

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
But it's not just incentives.

04:18.000 --> 04:21.000
It's also the products that we're going to continue to put in the market

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
to help you serve your customers.

04:23.000 --> 04:28.000
We have launched literally dozens of new products over the past several years

04:28.000 --> 04:33.000
that have been effective at helping you serve your customers, but we're not done there.

04:33.000 --> 04:36.000
We're continuing to invest in new products.

04:36.000 --> 04:40.000
And this year has an exciting schedule of new product launches.

04:40.000 --> 04:44.000
Look for what we're going to be doing with the Neutrolite brand in 2023

04:44.000 --> 04:49.000
to bring more excitement and energy to our most important product brand.

04:49.000 --> 04:53.000
I know your leadership is going to be sharing more information soon.

04:53.000 --> 04:58.000
So here we are in January looking ahead to what I'm confident is going to be

04:58.000 --> 05:01.000
an exciting, productive year.

05:01.000 --> 05:04.000
I know that you're all going to set goals.

05:04.000 --> 05:07.000
You're going to stretch yourself into an area of discomfort,

05:07.000 --> 05:10.000
but you're going to grow by striving for that goal,

05:10.000 --> 05:15.000
for focusing on the incentives that reward sustainable, profitable structures,

05:15.000 --> 05:20.000
and for serving your customers with the great products that we offer.

05:20.000 --> 05:24.000
And we're going to do it all in partnership as we always have done.

05:24.000 --> 05:27.000
The same foundation that Bill and Peggy built,

05:27.000 --> 05:31.000
and I am fortunate enough to continue to build with,

05:31.000 --> 05:37.000
Mock, Cowles, Kumar's, the Nardonis, the Millers, and the Malillos,

05:37.000 --> 05:40.000
and all the other leaders across BWW.

05:40.000 --> 05:46.000
Thank you for everything that you do every single day to continue to build your business.

05:46.000 --> 05:50.000
The whole corporation stands behind you and supports you.

05:50.000 --> 05:55.000
I look forward to hopefully seeing you soon, but until then, be well.
