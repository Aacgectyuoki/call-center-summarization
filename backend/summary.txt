MongoDB is a document database as opposed to our traditional column and row store databases. 
It uses a BSON format, which is basically a super set of JSON. 
So like any database, you have your basic CRUD operations, your create, read, update, and delete. 
It's going to be kind of similar to what you're familiar with if you've done a traditional database.
