- The approach is suitable for anyone with a spine, regardless of their injury history. 
- The method involves a simple exercise of sitting on the edge of a chair and leaning forward with a flat back. This trains the low back muscles.
- The exercise helps to reestablish communication with the back, which may have been lost due to injury, medication, and avoidance.
- The concept of "tissue tolerance" is emphasized, referring to the ability of the smallest tissue in the spine to handle weight. The program encourages gradual progress, starting with very small deposits to the low back.
- The goal is not just to preserve the low back but to build it. The program is a combination of training and education. 
- The approach encourages users to learn about their own backs, using any sensations of tightness or soreness as data. 
- Overall, the program is simple but requires confronting and overcoming fears. The first step of the program is the described sitting and leaning exercise.
