    Summarize the following transcript in a **structured bullet-point format**:
    - Use **bolded main points** for key topics.
    - Use **sub-bullets (‚ó¶)** for supporting details with double indentation.
    - Extract **technical terms** and define them simply.

    **Example Output Format**:
    
    **Bullet-Point Summary**
    **Introduction**
        ‚Ä¢ Mr. Abc, an SDE at Abc, introduces the fundamentals of database systems.
    
    **Agenda Overview**
        ‚Ä¢ Topics include general database overview, SQL, data storage, cloud computing, database management, internals of databases, and interview preparation.
    
    **Importance of Database Knowledge in Interviews**
        ‚Ä¢ Emphasis on broad knowledge in various database types and SQL for interviews.
        ‚Ä¢ Importance of demonstrating both breadth and depth of knowledge.
    
    **Types of Databases**
        ‚Ä¢ **SQL Databases**
          ‚ó¶ Traditional, relational databases with structured schema and static tables.
          ‚ó¶ Examples: Oracle, MySQL, SQL Server.
          ‚ó¶ Known for ACID properties ensuring reliable transaction processing.
        ‚Ä¢ **NoSQL Databases**
          ‚ó¶ More flexible, suitable for non-static schemas and horizontal scaling.
          ‚ó¶ Types include document, graph, and time-series databases.
          ‚ó¶ Examples: MongoDB, DynamoDB, Neo4J.

    **Technical Terms and Their Definitions**
        ‚Ä¢ **SDE (Software Development Engineer)**: A professional who applies engineering principles to software development.
        ‚Ä¢ **SQL (Structured Query Language)**: A programming language used for managing and manipulating relational databases.
        ‚Ä¢ **ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability)**: Properties that ensure reliable processing of database transactions.


    **Example Input Format 2 **:

    **Bullet-Point Summary**
    **Introduction to Cloud Computing Models**: 
        ‚Ä¢ **Overview of the three primary types of cloud services**: SaaS, IaaS, and PaaS.

    **Software as a Service (SaaS)** 
        ‚Ä¢ Defined as application access over the web, managed by a third-party vendor.
        ‚Ä¢ Benefits include avoiding software maintenance, infrastructure management, and security responsibilities.
        ‚Ä¢ Examples include Slack, Dropbox, and Google Apps (Gmail, Google Drive, Google Sheets).

    **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)** 
        ‚Ä¢ Provides on-demand computing and storage capabilities via the internet.
        ‚Ä¢ Operates on a pay-as-you-go billing model, where costs are based on resource usage.
        ‚Ä¢ Examples include Amazon EC2 for computing instances and Amazon DynamoDB for databases.

    **Technical Terms and Their Definitions*
        ‚Ä¢ **SaaS (Software as a Service)**: A software distribution model where applications are hosted by a third-party provider and delivered over the internet.
        ‚Ä¢ **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)**: Provides virtualized computing resources over the internet on a scalable, pay-as-you-go basis.
        ‚Ä¢ **PaaS (Platform as a Service)**: A cloud computing service that offers a platform for developing, running, and managing applications without the complexity of building and maintaining the underlying infrastructure.


    **Ensure the following**:
    - Main points should be bolded using "**bold text**".
    - Sub-bullets should start with "‚ó¶" and be indented.
    - Minimize use of jargon, but keep technical terms and provide examples.
    
    **Transcript**:
    {transcript}
    `
